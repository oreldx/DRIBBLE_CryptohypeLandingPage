# Dribble Design Implementation

Welcome to my first attempt at implementing this [design from Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/shots/16950858-NFT-Marketplace-Landing-Page-Animation?showSimilarShots=true&_=1638112485538) using HTML and SCSS. 

## Notes

This is my first time working with HTML and SCSS and building a design from Dribbble, so there may be issues or areas for improvement in the code.

I also tried to build the project as quickly as possible, so the code may not be optimized and the design may not be fully responsive. I spent around 4 hours.

I used 7-1 structure for the SCSS organization but it was overcomplicated for this simple project. I should have go for a simple one folder solution.

I also didn't follow the mobile first idea because I only built the large screen version (from the design found on Dribble), then think about the non-existing mobile version.
